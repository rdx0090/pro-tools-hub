            <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
            <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> [Aaj ki date daalein]</p>
            <p>At Pro Tools Hub, your privacy is our highest priority. This policy outlines how we handle information.</p>
            
            <h3>1. No Data Collection</h3>
            <p>We do not collect, store, or transmit any personal data or files from our users. All tools on this website (including the image compressor, QR generator, etc.) operate entirely on the client-side, meaning all processing is done within your own web browser on your own device. Your files are never uploaded to our or any third-party server.</p>
            
            <h3>2. Third-Party Libraries (CDNs)</h3>
            <p>Our website uses common, trusted third-party libraries (like SheetJS, jsPDF, etc.) hosted on Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) to provide functionality. These CDNs may collect standard, non-personally identifiable information like your IP address for security and analytics, as is standard practice for most websites. We do not have access to this data.</p>
            
            <h3>3. Cookies</h3>
            <p>We do not use tracking cookies. We may use local storage in your browser only to save your preferences (like settings for a tool), but this information is stored on your device and is not accessible to us.</p>
            
            <h3>4. Changes to This Policy</h3>
            <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new policy on this page.</p>
